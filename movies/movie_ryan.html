            <p>
              This isn’t just another movie review – it’s a controlled descent
              into the spinning-top heart of <em>Inception</em>. Think of this page as a dream
              architect’s notebook: a fixed, unblinking cityscape in the background while the words,
              images, and trailer slide over it like shifting dream layers. The header and footer stay
              locked in place like totems, anchoring you while the content drags you deeper into
              Nolan’s maze. Every paragraph is funneled into a clean reading column, not by accident,
              but by design – like a narrowed corridor guiding you toward the film’s most unsettling
              questions: What is real? What is memory? And why do we want to be deceived?

                <p>
                  Well, I finally got around to seeing this movie, arguably one of the most iconic and
                  definitive films of the 21st century, and one of the most significant films I had
                  never seen. Part of the reason I procrastinated so long with it (years) was because
                  I thought it would be one of those movies that is so sophisticated a normal person
                  can’t understand it. Usually with complex movies like these I actually follow along
                  pretty well until about the hour-fifteen minute mark, at which point I cease to
                  understand anything that’s happening (examples include <em>Minority Report</em>,
                  <em>The Fugitive</em>, and <em>Flightplan</em>). To my surprise I ended up following
                  along pretty well and enjoying the movie much more than I anticipated I would.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I’ve had a slight grudge against anything Christopher Nolan-related since I saw
                  <em>The Dark Knight</em> for the first time several months ago, which underwhelmed
                  me completely. Part of the reason I didn’t enjoy that film as much was because I had
                  a headache the entire time while watching it, but still. Anyways, I had had
                  <em>Inception</em> on DVD for quite a while and I decided that it was due time to see
                  it. And I’m glad I did; it is very well-made and actually I think most people will
                  find something to enjoy about it. I’m not gonna act like this is some unknown movie
                  that I’m the first one to discover, but I will say that it is quite good.
                </p>

                <img src="../photos/r-saito.jpg"
                     alt="Saito holding Fischer during a tense scene"
                     class="review-img">

                <p>
                  The plot follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled “extractor” who goes into
                  people’s subconscious to find information in dreams. Cobb and his fellow extractor
                  Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are tasked by a businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe)
                  to perform “inception” inside the subconscious of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy),
                  the son of one of Saito’s rival businessmen. Inception means putting an idea into a
                  mind, instead of taking one out, which is a lot more difficult. In this case, Saito
                  wants Cobb and Arthur to put the idea of destroying his father’s business into
                  Fischer’s head.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To do this, Cobb must assemble a team of other people who can pull this off,
                  including Eames (Tom Hardy), a conman, Ariadne (Elliot Page), who will design the
                  dream worlds, and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a scientist who is basically their getaway
                  driver. As the team starts to execute their mission Cobb has trouble because of his
                  dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) constantly entering the dreams. That’s the basic
                  idea; there is a LOT of other complicated stuff that could be considered spoilers
                  that I also won’t get into here.
                </p>

                     alt="Paris street folding upward in a dreamscape"
                     class="review-img">

                <p>
                  I definitely enjoyed at least 80% of this movie. In terms of originality of concepts
                  and creativity, <em>Inception</em> has a lot to offer. In fact, I’d even go as far as
                  to say that it centers around one of the most original movie ideas of the 2010’s.
                  The special effects and visual art are very well-done. It’s kind of a shame I didn’t
                  get to see it in theaters, but I would’ve only been five years old at the time and I
                  was busy watching more appropriate movies.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Christopher Nolan did a great job directing this—you can tell it took forever to
                  make. There were multiple scenes where I thought, “this must have cost a lot of
                  money.” Visually, it is extremely impressive.
                </p>

                <img src="../photos/r-rolling.jpeg"
                     alt="Rotating hallway fight scene"
                     class="review-img">

                <p>
                  The performances are decent and decent only, which is fine because this kind of
                  movie doesn’t require much advanced acting, although I would say DiCaprio did an
                  especially nice job. It’s also important how smoothly <em>Inception</em> blends
                  science fiction with action, thriller, and drama. If you aren’t usually a fan of
                  sci-fi, chances are you won’t mind this film. Despite this, <em>Inception</em> still
                  more than satisfies a sci-fi fan’s needs for the bending of time and space.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I will now praise the movie’s ambiguous and memorable ending: Cobb spins a top to
                  test reality vs. dream, walks away, and we’re left unsure if it will fall. That’s
                  now one of my favorite endings.
                </p>

                <img src="../photos/r-ending.jpg"
                     alt="Spinning top on the table in the final scene"
                     class="review-img review-img-right">

                <p>
                  I have a few small complaints, but they aren’t dealbreakers. My biggest problem is
                  how the early sound effects are almost ridiculously loud while dialogue can be
                  quiet. Turn it up to hear speech and then—boom—big crash. Another complaint (not the
                  film’s fault) is I dislike widescreen’s black bars. Lastly, it can be tricky at times
                  to know if we’re in a dream; perhaps that’s deliberate.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the end, I’m glad I can cross <em>Inception</em> off the long watchlist.
                  If you like action movies or longer, intelligent thrillers, this one’s worth it.
