                    <p>
                        Akira Kurosawa - genius of directing. Man, who managed to connect West and East. As unique as an author of story which was used as main plot in a movie - Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. Akutagawa managed to do undoable - under heave influence of western classics such as Dostoyevskiy and Edgar Allan Poe he put japanese
                        legends and stories on a paper in the way where both worlds can relate. His stories 'Rashomon' and 'In a Grove' were referenced as ones that were center of a movie's plot.
                        Maybe, this is why this movie was meant for success in Europe and United States - it was a fresh air for Hollywood with it's romantic dramas, propaganda movies, comedies and something new for European viewers, who were very busy rebuilding their country.
                        People didn't know how to react - Japan was so hidden behind news headlines. This movie changed it all - it changed confusion to curiosity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It start is simple. We see a woodcutter and a Buddhist monk, who takes shelter from a downpour under the Rashōmon gate. Area around the gate is destroyed, which makes us understand that country is not in it's best times. Our characters just came from trial about the murder of the Samurai.
                        Confused, uncertain - just like background where they are, but conversation kicks off and they discuss what they just witnessed, when commoner joins them.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <div class="row mb-5">
                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>
                        We are taken to the court yeard where main action of the movie will happen. Just like american 12 Angry Men - we feel like we are in the court yeard with characters, like we are the part of the process.
                        Trial starts and we have to listen to few stories in following order: woodcutter, priest, policeman, bandit, wife and killed samurai through a medium. Everyone provides their version of story. Everyone believes in its honesty. Viewer - gets an option to see their stories on a screen masterly depicted by actors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It might seem to be a straight-forward case. A man is killed and bandit caught on a crime scene. But, someone say he defended himself while others say that he is known criminal. 
                        That's where the difficulty is hidden. Whom to listen? To biased cop? Or to a medium who begs for mercy? All got their point. But this makes such a simple case much more complicated than it seems.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row mb-5 align-items-center">
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>
                        After all, we are left more confused than ever. Because even medium sounds like it got its point, even though they claim to represent a scene by communication with a dead samurai. Absurd? Yes. But that's why we love this movie.
                        The idea is straight-forward and brutal. We cannot rely on people testimonies during shocking events. Not because people lie. But each of them believes in what their mind is percieved from the scene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We cannot say that anyone lied. But we cannot believe to anyone too. And this it what life is about - it's about the perception.
                    </p>

                        This movie is 75 years old, but topic is relevant even today. And what is even better - Akira Kurosawa's work still feels fresh, you don't get tired from camera work as it's perfect. Acting is on spot, cast works incredibly well and we can see same lineup in future movies from Kurosawa.
                        Emotions that you can feel during the watch are so bright - you will laugh, you will want to cry, you will think. And that's what makes a good movie after all. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are looking for some brain food or if you want an interesting movie for an evening under 2 hours - this is an ideal option. It's a crowd pleaser even after 3/4 of a century. 
                        No matter what kind of viewer you are - you will find something to learn from this masterpiece. Thanks for reading. Yaroslav.
